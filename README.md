 SPA application in Vanilla JS. To achieve the SPA concept I used the history library to create my own router.
Tech stack:  JavaScript(ES6 modules, Axios, async-await, DOM, explicit binding), MVC design pattern, WebPack,  HTML & CSS (FlexBox, animation, absolute positioning), BootStrap.


<b>Currently, I am working on new features on this app, and the project will be live soon. </b>
